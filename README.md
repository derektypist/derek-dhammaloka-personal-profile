Welcome to the Derek Dhammaloka Personal Profile.  The purpose of this project is to have functionality similar to

## UX

This project is a personal portfolio of myself.  It contains four sections - about (welcome), work (projects), skills and contact.
The organising principle is biography.

The about (welcome section) is who I am and what I do.

The work (projects section) consists of 9 projects.  4 milestone projects with the Code Institute, where I got my Diploma in Software Development
with Second Class Honours.  1 mini project with the Code Institute about my CV.  4 projects on Responsive Web Design under https://www.freecodecamp.org.

Each project has a screenshot of the live project.  When the user clicks on to the screenshot, it opens the live project in a new window.
When a user hovers over the screenshot the border color changes to green and a screentip is provided.

There is a caption with a link to view source code (GitHub Repository).  If the user hovers over the GitHub logo, a screentip is displayed as well as changing
the color to orange.

The skills section is in 3 columns - Front End, Back End and Other.

The contact section provides links to my GitHub Profile, social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest) and Professional Organisations (e.g. British
Computer Society).
