# Derek Dhammaloka Personal Profile
 
Welcome to the Derek Dhammaloka Personal Profile.  The purpose of this project is to have functionality similar to
https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNBOYG
 
## UX

This project is a personal portfolio of myself.  It contains four sections - about (welcome), work (projects), skills and contact.
The organising principle is biography.

The about (welcome section) is who I am and what I do.

The work (projects section) consists of 9 projects.  4 milestone projects with the Code Institute, where I got my Diploma in Software Development
with Second Class Honours.  1 mini project with the Code Institute about my CV.  4 projects on Responsive Web Design under https://www.freecodecamp.org.

Each project has a screenshot of the live project.  When the user clicks on to the screenshot, it opens the live project in a new window.
When a user hovers over the screenshot the border color changes to green and a screentip is provided.

There is a caption with a link to view source code (GitHub Repository).  If the user hovers over the GitHub logo, a screentip is displayed as well as changing
the color to orange.

The skills section is in 3 columns - Front End, Back End and Other.

The contact section provides links to my GitHub Profile, social media (Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube and Pinterest) and Professional Organisations (e.g. British
Computer Society).

When the user hovers on the navbar, the background color changes to seagreen.

## Technologies

This project uses HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4.4.1.  Other Technologies used include Font Awesome 4.7.0 and Google Fonts.

## Testing

Resize the width of the browser window to see that the navbar is vertical for mobile versions.  Ensure all the links are manually tested
